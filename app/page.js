          I am a graduate student at Kanazawa University, specializing in
          Computational Science. I have a strong interest in data science,
          particularly in the field of material informatics. My research is to
          use AI to predict material properties. My practical experience as a
          data analyst at an agritech startup has enhanced my ability to extract
          valuable insights from diverse datasets, contributing to well-informed
          decision-making.
